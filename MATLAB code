% the below function takes a video file and an activity from the user as
% inputs  After the the video has
% been acquired it is processed and the red plane(intensity values) are
% extracted for later use.
% After the signal acquisition, a band-pass filter attenuates frequencies
% outside the interest band. This reduces the noise in later processing steps 
% (peak fine-tuning) and makes the resulting heart rate signal smoother.
% For our case, a second-order Butterworth filter is designed. The cutoff
% frequencies have been set to contain our band of interest: 40-230 bpm
% The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is used to translate the signal from
% the time domain to the frequency domain.
% Once the FFT is computed for the current sliding window contents, 
% magnitude peaks in the interest band are spotted thanks to the findpeaks
% function in Matlab. A sample is taken as a peak if it is either larger 
% than its two neighbors or equal to infinity. Among the resulting peaks, 
% the highest peak position is sought with the max function. Finally,
% it is translated to the corresponding frequency in the FFT vector:
% At this stage, an approximate location for the most powerful tone in the
% frequency band has been found, but the possible outcomes are a discrete 
% set in 10 bpm increments because of the frequency resolution produced by 
% the 6-second window. We would like that the heart rate readings look more 
% continuous, with 1 bpm frequency resolution instead. To achieve this, 
% the signal window is correlated with a series of tones in phase and 
% quadrature around the FFT peak in 1 bpm increments. The tones lie in the
% uncertainty interval around the peak caused by the FFT frequency 
% resolution. The result of each signal-tone correlation is a complex
% number representing a phase-magnitude pair. The frequency that
% corresponds to the highest magnitude is taken as the smoothed heart rate
% i have included a link below for detailed commenting on how this matlab
% function works.

% after the acquisition and the processing, the mean heart rate is computed
% and compared to the set value provided in the function. depending on the
% difference between the set value and the computed value, the program will
% output methods in which the user can adjust their heart rate to the
% proper rate.
% due to time pressure, we have assumed the testing and calibration stage
% has been completed already.
